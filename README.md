# React + Vite Application

This application is built using React and Vite, providing a fast and modern development environment. Below is an overview of what this app does and how it works.

## Purpose of the Application

This app is designed to [describe the purpose of your app, e.g., "send push notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)" or "manage tasks in a to-do list"]. It leverages modern web technologies to deliver a seamless user experience.

## Features

- **React Components**: Modular and reusable components for building the UI.
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (if applicable)**: Integration with FCM for sending and receiving push notifications.
- **Fast Development**: Built with Vite for fast builds and hot module replacement (HMR).
- **Custom Functionality**: [Add specific features, e.g., "User authentication," "Real-time updates," or "Dynamic routing."]

## How It Works

1. **Frontend**:  
   The app is built using React, with components organized in the `src/components` directory. Each component handles a specific part of the UI.

2. **Firebase Integration**:  
   [If applicable, explain how Firebase is used, e.g., "Firebase is used for push notifications and real-time database updates."]

## Getting Started

To run this app locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Start the Development Server**  
    Start the development server with:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will launch the application in development mode with hot module replacement (HMR).

## Testing

1. **Run Tests**  
   To create a production build, use:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## BUild the app

1. **Build for Production**  
    To create a production build, use:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   The production-ready files will be generated in the dist folder.

## Preview Build

1. **Preview the Production Build**  
    To preview the production build locally, run:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
